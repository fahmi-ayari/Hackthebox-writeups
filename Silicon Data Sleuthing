  CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
In the dust and sand surrounding the vault, you unearth a rusty PCB... You try to read the etched print
, it says Open..W...RT, a router! You hand it over to the hardware gurus and to their surprise the ROM Chip is intact!
They manage to read the data off the tarnished silicon and they give you back a firmware image. It's now your job to examine
the firmware and maybe recover some useful information that will be important for unlocking and bypassing some of the vault's countermeasures!
